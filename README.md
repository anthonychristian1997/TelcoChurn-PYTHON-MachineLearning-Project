# TelcoChurn-PYTHON-MachineLearning-Project-
In this project, in making machine learning that can do churn prediction. The first process we do is to identify data. Then resample it to provide balanced data. After that, the model is tested.

In this Repository, the model we use is the SVC model which gives an accuracy value of 0.77 and a precision value of 0.75.

After that, use Hyperparameter tuning on the model so that the accuracy and precision values ​​are increased to 0.82 and 0.79.

Finally, we checked whether the model was overfitting or not and it gave a result of 6.89%.
